## About The Storyverse Project 

In every great story is the spark of a new literary universe - the fictional parallel universe we go to as readers, and the ever-expanding 'storyverse' when versions of the characters, stories and narrative continue on in related literary works.


The Storyverse Project is a personally curated collection of 'canon' literary works with their related adaptations, retellings, and non-fiction. 

This collection connects traditional library classification and curated tags in order to share fuller context, and inspire your next read!
+ Standard subject headings and genres (shown as #sh/ and #g/) 
+ Key locations, real and imagined (shown as #loc/)
+ Key info on the story era and timeframe (shown as #era/)
+ 'Storyverse Folksonomy' tags (shown as #svf/)


## About This Site

This collection uses [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv) with Jekyll. For more info, visit [CB Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/).
